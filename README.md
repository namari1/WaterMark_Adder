# Watermark Adder
Add custom watermarks to images. Watermarked image will automatically save on your computer. Project runs on a tkinter interface.


1) Click "upload image" button to select a .png or .jpg image from your computer. The image will display on the left side of the app, with the image width and height below it.
2) Type in the text you want to add to your image in the text entry box.
3) Use the text-size scale to choose your font size (10-80). 
4) Choose a font from the drop-down list. Font must be chosen in order to add watermark.
5) Select the X and Y position you want your watermark to be on the image--the top left of the image has coordinates of (0,0) and the bottom right has the coordinates of (image width, image height); use your image width and height to gauge desired coordinates of watermark. The watermark text will start at those coordinates. X and Y positions must be chosen to add watermark. 
6) Use the opacity scale (0-255) to select the desired opacity of watermark (0: fully transparent, won't see the watermark; 255: fully opaque, will see the watermark in its full color; ex: at 128, the watermark will be at half-opacity)
7) The color of the watermark is in RGB format, so use the scales (0-255) to get a precise color. 
8) Choose what angle you want your watermark to display (0-360).  
9) Lastly, click the "add watermark" button to add the watermark to your image and automatically save the new image to your computer.
